  <p className='p-style'>I am a mother of two little angels! They inspired me to start making personalized wooden toys that are fun and safe for children any age. <br /><strong>-Ekaterina Hawthorne</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>Recommendations: </strong><br /><br/>What a beautiful toy! The beads are such a great quality, too! My son enjoys playing and chewing on it. Hand made toys just make it so much more special. 
Definitely recommend!<br /><br />Since my daughter has been teething and drooling nonstop lately, she’s been finding things to put in her mouth left and right! Thankfully this gem caught her eyes and she hasn’t stopped playing with it! This custom pacifier clip/teether is the best and absolutely adorable. This is the perfect gift for baby showers or your little ones!<br /> <br />
I ordered a custom teether as a baby shower gift. What an adorable gift it was! You won't be able to find anything like this from other retailers. Happy kids accessories worked with me on the design taking into consideration all my wants and needs. Will definetly order again!
